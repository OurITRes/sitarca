# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines code ownership and review requirements for the repository.
# 
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Owners will be automatically requested for review when someone opens a PR
# that modifies files matching the pattern.
#
# Note: Teams (@OurITRes/docs-team, @OurITRes/ops-team) must be created in your
# GitHub organization. If teams don't exist yet, see docs/GOVERNANCE_SETUP.md
# for instructions, or replace team references with individual usernames.
